# Blockquotes
To create a block quote, add **"greater than"** caret (>). For example:
> "It is widely acknowledged that the drivers for energy consumption in the residential sector are ambient temperature, energy demand, population density, and socio-economic conditions. However, there are no studies in the literature assessing the temporal and spatial distribution of these drivers for a region or country."
> 
> "The decision-making process of the energy transition will be enhanced by using geospatial-resolved and temporal-explicit energy consumption drivers. This study estimates the climatic, end-use demands, and socio-economic drivers of energy consumption in the residential sector of Ecuador at a high spatio-temporal resolution between 2010 and 2020." _Source:_ [**Moya et al.**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196890422004253)
